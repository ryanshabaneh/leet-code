# 79. Word Search
# https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/
# Difficulty: Medium
#
# Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if
# word exists in the grid.
#
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
# where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
# letter cell may not be used more than once.
#
# Example 1:
#   Input:  board = [["A","B","C","E"],
#                    ["S","F","C","S"],
#                    ["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
#   Output: true
#
# Example 2:
#   Input:  board = [["A","B","C","E"],
#                    ["S","F","C","S"],
#                    ["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
#   Output: true
#
# Example 3:
#   Input:  board = [["A","B","C","E"],
#                    ["S","F","C","S"],
#                    ["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
#   Output: false
#
# Constraints:
#   m == board.length
#   n == board[i].length
#   1 <= m, n <= 6
#   1 <= word.length <= 15
#   board and word consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
